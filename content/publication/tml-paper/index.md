abstract: The interdisciplinary process of space systems engineering poses challenges for the development of the on-board software. The software integrates components from different domains and organizations and has to fulfill requirements, such as robustness, reliability, and real-time capability. Model-based methods not only help to give a comprehensive overview, but also improve productivity by allowing artifacts to be generated from the model automatically. However, general-purpose modeling languages, such as the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), are not always adequate because of their ambiguity resulting from their generic nature. Furthermore, sensor data handling, analysis, and processing of data in on-board software requires focus on the systems data flow and event mechanism. To achieve this, we developed the Tasking Modeling Language (TML) which allows system engineers to model complex event-driven software systems in a simplified way and to generate software from the model. Type and consistency checks on the formal level help to reduce errors early in the engineering process. TML is focused on data-driven systems and its models are designed to be extended and customized to specific mission requirements. This paper describes the architecture of TML in detail, explains the base technology, the methodology, and the developed domain specific languages (DSLs). It evaluates the design approach of the software via a case study and presents advantages as well as challenges faced.
